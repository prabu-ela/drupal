"3525","<h3>Product Information</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>What do your popcorn bags sell for?</h3>
<div>
<p>We suggest selling <i>Cake Batter</i> popcorn for $12 a bag.</p></div>
<h3>How many bags are in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>12</p></div>
<h3>What size is each bag?</h3>
<div>
<p>5.5 oz each</p></div>
<h3>How long does your popcorn stay fresh?</h3>
<div>
<p>6 months from the date of production. To maintain freshness, popcorn should be stored in a cool dry place.</p></div>
<h3>Why do bag weights differ by flavor?</h3>
<div>
<p>The volume and number of kernels in every bag is relatively equal. The difference is in the weight of the coatings used for each popcorn flavor.</p>
<p>For example, cheese or savory flavors weigh less than sweet coating on popcorn.</p></div>
<h3>Can flavors be mixed in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. All flavors are preselected and cases cannot be broken up.</p></div>
<h3>Is popcorn gluten free?</h3>
<div>
<p>We hand pop our non-GMO kernels in coconut oil. Our popcorn is certified gluten free, and contains no artificial colors, flavorings, or preservatives. Made with real blue cheese and other natural flavors.</p></div>
</div>"

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is a 5 case minimum order requirement.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 25 participants wants everyone to sell 1 case each (12 bags):<br />
</p><blockquote>25 participants x 1 case / participant = 25 cases
<p>25 cases x 12 bags / case = 300 bags</p>
<p>300 bags x $12 / bag = $3,600.00 gross sales</p>
<p>$3,600.00 x 40% profit = <strong>$1,440.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 40% because you would need to order 25 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

<p>We suggest selling <i>Jalapeño Blue Cheese</i> popcorn for $12 a bag.</p></div>
<h3>How many bags are in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>12</p></div>
<h3>What size is each bag?</h3>

<p>6 oz each</p></div>
<h3>How long does your popcorn stay fresh?</h3>
<div>

<h3>Why do bag weights differ by flavor?</h3>

<p>For example, cheese or savory flavors weigh less than sweet coating on popcorn.</p></div>
<h3>Can flavors be mixed in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. All flavors are preselected and cases cannot be broken up.</p></div>
<h3>Is popcorn gluten free?</h3>
<div>
<p>We hand pop our non-GMO kernels in coconut oil. Our popcorn is certified gluten free, and contains no artificial colors, flavorings, or preservatives. Made with real blue cheese and other natural flavors.</p></div>

<p>A sponsor with 25 participants wants everyone to sell 1 case each (8 bags):<br />
</p><blockquote>25 participants x 1 case / participant = 25 cases
<p>25 cases x 8 bags / case = 200 bags</p>
<p>200 bags x $12 / bag = $2,400.00 gross sales</p>
<p>$2,400.00 x 40% profit = <strong>$960.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 40% because you would need to order 25 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

</p><blockquote>56 participants x 1 tote / participant = 56 totes
<p>56 totes x 24 units / tote = 1,344 units</p>
<p>1,344 units  x $3.00 / unit = $4,032.00 gross sales</p>
<p>$4,032.00 x 35% profit = <strong>$1,411.20 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 35% because you would need to order 10 cases (Volume discounts apply):<br />
</p><blockquote>56 participants x 1 tote / participant = 56 totes
<p>56 totes ÷ 6 totes / case = 9.3 cases (Round up)</p>

<h3>Are pretzel rods individually wrapped?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes</p></div>
<h3>Can flavors be mixed in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. All flavors are preselected and cases cannot be broken up.</p></div>
<h3>How long do pretzel rods stay fresh?</h3>
<div>
<p><i>Peanut Free</i> pretzel rods have a 9 month shelf life from the date of production. To maintain freshness, pretzel rods should be stored in a cool dry place.</p></div>
<h3>Are pretzel rods gluten free?</h3>
<div>
<p>They are not gluten free because the pretzels contain wheat. The first ingredient is pretzel rod, not a fruit, vegetable or whole grain. Therefore they don't fully meet the Smart Snacks program requirements.</p></div>
<h3>Are the pretzel rods certified peanut free?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, <i>Peanut Free</i> pretzel rods are made in a peanut free facility.</p>
<p>This area is completely closed off from the rest of the plant. Only authorized personnel are allowed in this area. We examine samples of each production lot for traces of peanuts.</p>
<p>The  peanut-free zone uses its own equipment which isn't used for any other process. Only peanut-free zone employees work in this area. They are never transferred to the regular factory nor do they have access to it.</p>
<p>Our facility is 'peanut-free certified' and is regularly  inspected by government agencies.</p></div>

<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 60 participants wants everyone to sell 30 pretzel rods:<br />
</p><blockquote>60 participants x 30 pretzel rods / participant = 1,800 pretzel rods
<p>1,800 pretzel rods ÷ 240 pretzel rods / case = 7.5 cases (Round up)</p>
<p>8 cases x 240 pretzel rods / case = 1,920 pretzel rods</p>
<p>1,920 pretzel rods x $1.00 / pretzel rod = $1,920.00 retail</p>
<p>$1,920.00 x 35% profit = <strong>$672.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 35% because you would need to order 8 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

</p><blockquote>50 participants x 30 bags / participant = 1,500 bags
<p>1,500 bags ÷ 120 bags / case = 12.5 cases (Round up)</p>
<p>13 cases x 120 bags / case = 1,560 bags</p>
<p>1,560 bags x $2.00 / bag = $3,120.00 retail</p>
<p>$3,120.00 x 55% profit = <strong>$1,716.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 55% because you would need to order 13 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>

<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 75 participants wants everyone to sell 6 tumblers:<br />
</p><blockquote>75 participants x 6 tumblers / participant = 450 tumblers
<p>450 tumblers ÷ 24 tumblers / case = 18.75 cases (Round up)</p>
<p>19 cases x 24 tumblers / case = 456 tumblers</p>
<p>456 tumblers x $20.00 / tumbler = $9,120.00 retail</p>
<p>$9,120.00 x 45% profit = <strong>$4,104.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 45% because you would need to order 19 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is a 1 case minimum order requirement.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 55 participants wants everyone to sell 16 smens:<br />
</p><blockquote>55 participants x 16 smens / participant = 880 smens
<p>880 smens ÷ 320 smens / case = 2.75 cases (Round up)</p>
<p>3 cases x 320 smens / case = 960 smens</p>
<p>960 smens x $2.00 / smen = $1,920.00 retail</p>
<p>$1,920.00 x 45% profit = <strong>$864.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 45% because you would need to order 3 cases (Volume discounts apply).</p>

<h3>How much do tumblers sell for?</h3>
<div>
<p>We suggest selling <i>Kendal</i> tumblers for $25 each.</p></div>
<h3>How many tumblers are in a case?</h3>
<div>
<p>20</p></div>
<h3>Are the tumblers thermally insulated?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Kendal tumblers are designed to keep liquid hot for up to 8 hours and cold for up to 24 hours. They are vacuum insulated and come with a slide close lid.</p></div>
<h3>What is the quality?</h3>
<div>
<p><i>Kendal</i> tumblers are kitchen-grade 18/8 premium grade stainless steel. They are made from 16%-18% chromium and 8%-10% nickel which are the top quality industry standards. Both metals add strength to the steel while nickel improves the resistance to corrosion.</p>
<p>Lids are clear and slide to open and close.</p></div>
<h3>Do we choose our own logo?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Before submitting the design form you’ll be able to upload your logo.</p></div>
<h3>How large is our logo on the tumbler?</h3>
<div>
<p>To maximize impact, we’ll do a two-sided or wrap around design. The graphic area is 3”x3”.</p></div>
<h3>What are our logo color options?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can choose up to 3 colors. Silver is our laser design option. It’s cut through the tumbler color coating to reveal the logo in silver.</p></div>
<h3>Are tumblers dishwasher safe?</h3>
<div>
<p>Had washing is recommended. And because <i>Kendal</i> tumblers are metallic, do not use in the microwave.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is a 1 case minimum order requirement.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 56 participants wants everyone to sell 1 tote each (20 units):<br />
</p><blockquote>56 participants x 1 tote / participant = 56 totes
<p>56 totes x 20 units / tote = 1,120 units</p>
<p>1,120 units  x $2.00 / unit = $2,240.00 gross sales</p>
<p>$2,240.00 x 35% profit = <strong>$784.00 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 35% because you would need to order 10 cases (Volume discounts apply):<br />

<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>

<p>Simply upload your images on our <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/scratch-card-design-form"" target=""_blank"">design form</a>. When you enter your group's name, we’ll add it to your card.</p>

<p>We don’t offer any prize programs with our discount card fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How often can cards be used?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each merchant on your card will honor their discount one time each day.</p>
<p>Cards are not valid with any other coupons, discounts, offers or promotions. You may not use them for alcohol, tax or tip, and are non-transferable.</p></div>
<h3>Do discount cards expire?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, after you receive your cards, they’ll expire on the first day of the 13<sup>th</sup> month.</p>
<p>For example, if you receive your cards in August, they'll expire on September 1<sup>st</sup> of the following year. We’ll put the date the card expires on your card.</p></div>
<h3>How do businesses get placed?</h3>
<div>
<p>We do the work of contacting and securing the merchants for your discount card. We contract with local, regional and national businesses from around the country.</p>
<p>You choose the merchants. So we can build a card that is well-designed and easy for potential buyers to read, we limit each card to 12 merchants.</p>
<p>We ask that you provide at least 36 businesses when you complete your design form. Occasionally, we need to contact additional merchants.</p>
<p>We recommend that you select well-known businesses. 80% of a typical card are eating establishments.</p></div>
<h3>How do businesses benefit?</h3>
<div>
<p>The benefits for businesses include free advertising, valuable publicity, and increased foot traffic. There's no cost to them for being on your card.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to give back and support the cause of a local school or organization.</p>
<p>Merchants must sign an agreement stating they'll honor their discount. We'll send the merchant a copy of the finished card so they can forward it to their employees.</p></div>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How much do the cards sell for?</h3>
<div>
<p>Cards typically sell for $10. Some groups may request a higher price but we don't recommend selling them for over $20. If you’re interested in increasing your profit even more, we'll put whatever price you want on your card.</p></div>
<h3>What is the card size?</h3>
<div>
<p>375” x 2.125” (credit card size)</p></div>
<h3>What types of discounts are there?</h3>
<div>
<p>We'll ask merchants to provide a “buy one get one free” offer, a percentage off, or a dollar discount. But at the end of the day, it's up to the merchant to decide which offer works best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Will our card be valid at multiple locations?</strong></p>
<p>For businesses with more than one location, cards are only valid at the address listed on the back of the card.</p></div>
<h3>What is the quality of the card?</h3>
<div>
<p>We produce all cards to the following standards:
</p><ul>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. The minimum order is 250 cards.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor decides to order 600 cards. The group has 75 members which means that each participant will need to sell 8 discount cards:<br />
</p><blockquote>75 participants x 8 discount cards / participant = 600 cards
<p>600 cards x $10.00 / card = $6,000.00 gross sales</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The card order is between 500-999 so the profit is 50%:<br />
</p><blockquote>$6,000.00 x 50% profit = <strong>$3,000.00 profit</strong></blockquote>
<p><strong>QUICK TIP:</strong> Enter your group size and participant goal into our ‘Profit Calculator’ found on the top right.</p></div>
<h3>Can we order more cards?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, you can order extra cards at the same rate as your initial order. For example, if your initial order was for 500 cards, you received 50% profit. So on any reorders, you’ll receive the same profit.</p>
<p>The smallest reorder quantity is 100 cards. Since your card is already in our system, printing usually takes about 3-5 business days. This does not include the time needed to ship your order.</p></div>
<h3>Do you take back unsold cards?</h3>
<div>
<p>We don't take back unsold cards since we build the card exclusively for your organization.</p></div>

<p>Smencils are smelly pencils of typical thickness to wood pencils only they're made from 100% recycled newspapers. Rolled newspaper sheets form around each core until the right pencil thickness results. Then they're hardened. This allows each smencil to be sharpened just like wooden pencils.

<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>108 bags x 16 units / bag = 1,728 units</p>

<p>$1,296.00 x 55% profit = <strong>$712.80 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 55% because you would need to order 7 cases (Volume discounts apply):<br />

<p>There is a 1 case minimum order requirement.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>Estimating your profit is easy. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>A sponsor with 54 participants wants everyone to sell 2 bags each (16 units / bag):<br />
</p><blockquote>54 participants x 2 bag / participant = 108 bags
<p>108 bags x 16 units / bag = 1,728 units</p>
<p>1,728 units  x 75¢ / unit = $1,296.00 gross sales</p>
<p>$1,296.00 x 55% profit = <strong>$712.80 profit</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The profit would be 55% because you would need to order 7 cases (Volume discounts apply):<br />
</p><blockquote>54 participants x 2 bags / participant = 108 bags
<p>108 bags ÷ 16 bags / case = 6.75 cases (Round up)</p>
