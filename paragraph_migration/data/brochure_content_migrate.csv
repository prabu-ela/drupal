3579,1,1642276477,"<h2>Questions about Hello Spring?</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your group raises money when your participants take orders from the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each participant receives a brochure, order form, and zip-lock bag for money collection.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>Hello Spring</i> brochure fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Prize programs are optional but recommended. Incentivizing your participants can improve sales. It’s important to discuss your prize program at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to promote your incentives throughout your sale. This will keep your group motivated.</p>
<p>If your group has 100 or more participants, a prize flyer is placed in each seller’s packet. For smaller groups, the sponsor receives a PDF with their ‘fundraiser supply kit’ email.</p>
<p>There is no cost to the group for our incentive plans.</p>
<p><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/fundraiser-prize-programs"" target=""_blank"">Learn about our prize programs</a></p></div>
<h3>How soon can we start?</h3>
<div>
<p>After you submit our <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form you’ll receive an agreement to sign. It will then take at least 7-10 business days to process your order and pack and ship out your supplies.</p>
<p><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/school-fundraising-supply-timeline"" target=""_blank"">Learn about our timeline</a></p></div>
<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>
<div>
<p>By default, we’ll set your end date 2 weeks after your start date. You can always change your end date. Simply let us know before your sale ends.</p></div>
</div>",
3579,1,1642276477,"<h3>Online Store</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, an online store is automatically included. Prior to your <i>Hello Spring</i> kickoff you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> revenue source to your fundraiser.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to raise money online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>The link takes people to your store where the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it identifiable to friends and family. For example, “Purchases from this page will be credited to John Doe in support of ABC High School Band.”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">additional incentives</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive a unique program ID number. Participants will need it to register and share their store link with others using social media, text, and email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can register and obtain your unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold or prize credit.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. Participants need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>
</div>",
3579,1,1642276477,"<h3>Making Sales</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Hello Spring</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participants = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $13 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $13 = $7,800.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $8,400 x 40% = <strong>$3,360</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>
<h3>Can we track our sales?</h3>
<div>
<p>You may not know your exact <i>Hello Spring</i> brochure sales until the end. Yet there are strategies that can give you a ballpark idea. Learn how to <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/how-track-your-fundraising-progress"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraising progress</a></p>
<p>But you'll be able to track online sales in real-time. By logging into your dashboard you'll see participants who’ve sent emails to friends and family as well as up-to-date sales activity.</p></div>
<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in your account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once the order has been processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> Once your brochure invoice has been paid in full, a check for any online sales is sent to your group.</p>
<p><strong>Donations:</strong> Any profits from donations are included with the online sales check.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups make 40% off all <i>Hello Spring</i> brochure and online sales.</p>
<p>You receive 70% of online donations.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p></div>
<h3>What about sales tax?</h3>
<div>
<p>Certain states require that we collect and remit sales tax on your behalf to your state’s department of revenue. We will need to charge sales tax if your state has determined that we have established <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/nexus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nexus</a> and you are not tax exempt. See our <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""/resources/ultimate-school-brochure-fundraising-tax-guide"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">brochure fundraising tax guide</a> for more information.</p></div>
</div>",
3579,1,1642276477,"<h3>Shipping</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How soon do we receive our order?</h3>
<div>
<p>We deliver brochure orders to your group 3-4 weeks after receiving your order forms. Online orders generally ship to customers within 2 business days after purchase.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where do orders ship to?</h3>
<div>
<p>Product ships out of our Texas warehouse to all lower 48 states.</p>
</div>
<h3>How is our order packed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Orders arrive prepacked by seller.</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a shipping fee?</h3>
<div>
<h5>Brochure Sales:</h5>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />
</p><table border=""0"">

<tr>
<td>$15-$19.99</td>
<td>50¢ / Enrolled</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$20+</td>
<td>No Charge</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes this is an option. Instead of shipping <i>Hello Spring</i> brochure orders to your group, we’ll ship them to each participant. Sellers would then need to distribute items to their customers.</p>
<p>Home delivery fundraisers go by the following profit margins:</p>

<tr>
<td>$1,000 to $14,999</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$15,000</td>
<td>32%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p> Orders under $1,000 in gross sales will be shipped to the group.</p></div>
<h3>How are product issued handled?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you have any items that need replacing, you’ll need to submit a form that we’ll attach to your delivery notice email. Sellers will have 7 days to report any missing or damaged items. Groups are allowed 1 submission per fundraiser.</p></div>

<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ship to Group Option</strong></p>
<p>To help cover shipping fees for your online customers, you can add a ‘ship to group’ option to your store. People can then choose to pay a shipping fee and have items delivered to them, or pay a 5% processing fee and have their order shipped to your group.</p>
<p>For example, a $50 order would be charged an additional $2.50 ($50 x 5% = $2.50). The total cost for the order would therefore be $52.50.</p>
<p>We then combine all ‘ship to group’ orders and ship them to your location after your sale is over.</p>
<p>'Ship to group' is not automatically included as part of a <i>Goodies & Gifts Online</i> sale. Thus you will need to let us know if you want this option included. You can do so by putting ""Add ship to group"" in the comments section before you submit your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-online-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</p></div>

3149,1,1643337986,"<h2>Questions about Popcornopolis Online?</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Profit is made from the purchase of every item from your store. Once participants register, they’re able to invite family and friends to shop. Invitations are sent out via social media, text, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Your group receives a profit off every sale.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to promote a <i>Popcornopolis Online</i> fundraiser. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause.</p>
<p>Prior to completing the registration process, participants will be required to enter their email address. This is needed so we can send them their letter to forward to friends and family. All email addresses are kept confidential and are only used for fundraising purposes.</p>
<p>Once participants are registered, they’ll be able to share your fundraiser using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>As people click on a link, your group’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it recognizable to friends and family. For example, “Welcome to ABC High School Band.”</p>
<p>Supporters will also see how much money the group has raised so far as well as the end goal. The name of the participant they’re supporting and how much they’ve raised is also shown.</p>
<p>From your sponsor portal, you can view both individual and group sales progress. You’ll also be able to see how many participants have registered and the number of unique visitors they've had.</p>
<p>Getting participants to register is vital to your success. You can enhance sales by setting individual seller goals based on your group’s needs.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p>
<p>Be sure to <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""/tracking-school-fundraisers"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraiser progress</a> and remind participants to invite people to shop. This will encourage them to reach their goal. Participants can track their own sales when logged into their portal.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to win prizes. We encourage groups to supplement the prize program we offer with additional incentives.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, you’ll receive your school ID number. Participants will need it to register, obtain their unique link, and then share it with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Registration:</strong> Or, as an option we will send you a link that you can provide to your participants to forward to their family and friends. Supporters would only need to enter your school ID # and then your group name or a student that they want to support. Your sellers would not need to register.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using quick registration, you would only be able to track sales as a group, not by individual seller. You would also not be able to use our prize programs.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation to sellers not registering is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected with each order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is no in person ordering or money collection. Participants generate sales when the people they invite buy items from your store.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants track their own sales?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, participants will be able to log into their portal anytime and see their sales updates.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or costs to run a <i>Popcornopolis Online</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Motivating your group with prizes can improve sales. It’s important that you promote your incentives throughout your sale. This will keep your participants motivated to keep sharing with others.</p>
<p>We offer 2 prize program options:
</p><ol>
<li><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/sites/default/files/online-cash-prize-program.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cash</a></li>
<li><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/sites/default/files/get-it-all-prize-program.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Traditional</a></li>

<p>Getting participants to register is key to your success. You can enhance sales by setting individual seller goals based on your group’s needs.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p>
<p>Be sure to <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""/tracking-school-fundraisers"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraiser progress</a> and remind participants to invite people to your store. This will help your participants reach their goal.</p>
<p>Registered participants will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement the prize program we offer with additional incentives.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, participants will need to register and then share their unique link with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can first register yourself as a seller and forward your link to your group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.
<p>To access your link, login as that seller. Once on your seller dashboard click on the email icon. The email will open and in the body of the email you’ll see your personal shopping link.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a single link, you will not be able to track sales by seller. Your group would also not be able to use our prize programs.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation to sellers not registering is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected with each order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is no in person ordering or money collection. Participants generate sales when the people they invite buy items from your store.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants track their own sales?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, participants will be able to log into their portal anytime and see their sales updates.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or costs to run a <i>Believe Online</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Incentivizing your participants can improve sales. We offer 2 prize program options:
</p><ol>
<li><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/sites/default/files/online-cash-prize-program.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Cash</a></li>
<li><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/sites/default/files/prize-fever.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Traditional</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We send you your prize flyer via email before your kickoff. It’s important that you continue to promote your prizes throughout your sale. This will keep your group motivated.</p>
<p>After your sale is over, we add the total cash amount to your profit check. If you choose a traditional prize plan, we ship your prizes to your group address. Prizes are packed by participant.</p>
<p>You’ll receive a sales report showing your participants names and how much they sold. Prizes are shipped with a reference list that matches prizes with participants.</p>
<p>There is no cost to the group for our prize programs.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Because this is an online fundraiser there are no brochures. Before your sale, you’ll receive a registration instruction steps email. Be sure to forward it to your sellers.</p></div>
<h3>How soon can we start?</h3>
<div>
<p>After you submit our <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-online-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form you’ll receive an agreement to sign. It will then take at least 3-5 business days to process your order and set up your store.
</p><p>Once we send you your participant registration instruction steps, your store is live. We recommend that you have an official kickoff meeting so everyone starts at the same time.</p>
<p>If you can't meet in person, consider using an online communication technology. Examples include Zoom, Cisco Webex, GoToMeeting and Google Hangouts.</p></div>
<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>
<div>
<p>By default, we set your end date 2 weeks after your start date. You can always change your end date. Simply let us know before your sale ends.</p>
<p>Or, let us know up front when you want your store to close.</p></div>
<h3>Do you only work with schools?</h3>
<div>
<p>No, we work with non-school groups as well. Examples include church groups, sports leagues, and dance organizations.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can we use more than 1 store at a time?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. You must choose 1 store. For example, ‘Goodies & Gifts’ cannot be run at the same time as ‘Popcornopolis Online’. You can always run a second online fundraiser after the first one is over.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you only work with groups?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Your group must have at least 5 participants.</p></div>

<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, people can donate in $20 increments. Your group receives 70% profit off all donations.</p>
<p>Or if you don't want a donation option on your store you can have this feature turned off. Simply let us know before your fundraiser start date.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Multiple participants can be added under the same account when registering. So when they make a purchase, the prize credit is automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who click on a link that was shared with them through text, email or social media and the sellers are all registered under the same dashboard, the prize credit is also automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who go directly to the store, select shop now, and manually enter the information will need to click on the “+” symbol to add multiple participants prior to entering the online store.</p>
<p>Donations count as 1 prize credit for each $20 donation.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ship to Group Option</strong></p>
<p>To help cover shipping fees for your online customers, you can add a ‘ship to group’ option to your store. People can then choose to pay a shipping fee and have items delivered to them, or pay a 5% processing fee and have their order shipped to your group.</p>
<p>Like the 'ship to home' option, if the customer orders $75 or more of merchandise there are no additional fees. For orders less than $75, a 5% processing fee is added at checkout.</p>
<p>For example, a $50 order would be charged an additional $2.50 ($50 x 5% = $2.50). The total cost for the order would therefore be $52.50.</p>
<p>We then combine all ‘ship to group’ orders and ship them to your location after your sale is over.</p>
<p>'Ship to group' is not automatically included as part of a <i>Believe Online</i> sale. Thus you will need to let us know if you want this option included. You can do so by putting ""Add ship to group"" in the comments section before you submit your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-online-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</p></div>

<h3>Online Store Options</h3>

<p>You can choose between 3 different online stores:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>$14 Dough Only.</strong> 2 lb. tubs</li>
<li><strong>America’s Favorite Treats.</strong> This includes 2 lb. and 2.7 lb. tubs, edible dough, and popcorn.</li>
<li><strong>Full Inventory.</strong> This includes 2 lb. tubs, 2.7 lb. tubs and preportioned, edible dough, and popcorn.</li>

<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to promote a <i>Cookie Dough Online</i> fundraiser. It's a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause.</p>
<p>Prior to completing the registration process, participants will be required to enter their email address. This is needed so we can send them their personalized online store link. All email addresses are kept confidential and are only used for fundraising purposes.</p>
<p>Once participants are registered, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>As people click on a link, they will see a personalized message from the participant they’re supporting. For example, “Purchases from this site support John Doe at ABC Band”.</p>
<p>As the sponsor, you can track both individual and group sales progress. Besides dollars raised, you’ll be able to see who’s registered.</p>
<p>Getting participants to register is key to your success. You can enhance sales by setting individual seller goals based on your group’s needs.</p>

<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>

<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, you will be provided a link to forward to your participants. Once they click on it and register, they will receive their own unique online store link via email. They can then share their link with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, as an option we can create 1 unique group link that would bypass the registration process. Your group would be able to share this link with their friends and family.
<p>Or, register and obtain your own unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</p></li>

<p>Orders generally ship within 3-5 business days after purchase.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where do orders ship to?</h3>
<div>
<p>Product ships from our Louisiana warehouse to all lower 48 states. All items ship direct to the buyer.</p></div>
<h3>Who pays the shipping fee?</h3>
<div>
<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping rates are determined by FedEx based on quantity and weight of items ordered. There are no added processing fees.</p>
<p>Cookie dough is a very dense product and requires special handling because it ships frozen. The cost of shipping is therefore typically higher than for the average product. </p>
<p>Freight costs vary and will depend on the weight and zip code of the destination. Prices are dictated by our 3<sup>rd</sup> party carriers. Their rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><h5>Ship to Group Option</h5>

<p>To help cover any shipping fees for your online customers, you can add a ‘ship to group’ option to your store. People can then choose to pay a fee and have items shipped to them, or not pay and have their order shipped to your group.</p>
<p>We then combine all ‘ship to group’ orders and ship them together to your location after your sale is over.</p>
<p><strong>Ship to Group Fees</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to get more people to buy by offering them free shipping for online orders. But 'ship to group' is not free to your organization. We'll deduct the cost to ship your order from your profit check.</p>
<p>The average shipping cost per item is much lower for one large order than for individual orders. The cost is based on the distance from our warehouse as well as the size and weight of the order.</p>
<p>Both 'ship to group' and 'ship to home' orders factor into the item total. The more 'ship to home' items you have, the lower your 'ship to group' shipping cost.</p>
<p><strong>Size of Order</strong></p>
<p>For orders of 36 items or less, we'll ship your order to your group bulk and only pass on the shipping charge. If you end up selling 37-249 items we charge $170 to pack orders by participant, plus shipping.</p>
<p>For orders of 250-499 items, we charge 75¢ per item to prepack your orders. You will also be charged the shipping fee.</p>
<p>You will only pay the 75¢ per item packing fee once you sell 500 or more items. There will be no shipping fee.</p>
<p><strong>Bulk Orders</strong></p>
<p>'Ship to group' orders greater than 36 items are prepacked and labeled by seller. We do not recommend bulk shipping for larger orders. You would not have to pay the packing fee, but you would have to order each flavor by the full case.</p>
<p>So for example, if you initially ordered only 1 of a particular flavor you would have to accept and pay for the extra 5. Bulk orders only come in full cases of 6 regardless of the flavor.</p>
<p>Even though you could sell the extra items and raise more money, the upfront cost could be significant.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Cost Breakdown</strong></p>

3143,1,1643485083,"<h2>Questions about Charleston Wrap Online?</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups raise money when supporters buy items from their online store. Once participants register, they can invite family and friends to shop. Invitations go out via social media, text, and/ or email and groups receive a profit off every sale.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to promote a <i>Charleston Wrap Online</i> fundraiser. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause.</p>
<p>Prior to completing the registration process, participants will be required to enter their email address and phone number. All personal information is kept confidential and is only used for fundraising purposes.</p>
<p>Once participants are registered, they’ll be able to share the store link and their participant code #.</p>
<p>Before entering the store, supporters will see a personalized group confirmation popup. For example, “Every purchase supports ABC High School Band"". The participant's name and picture (optional) they're supporting also appears. They can start shopping once they click on the ‘shop’ button.</p>
<p>As the sponsor, you'll be able to track things like:
</p><ul>
<li>The number of participants who've registered</li>
<li>How many have sent out invite emails</li>
<li>Sales progress</li>
</ul>
<p> Your success depends on getting participants to register. You can grow your sales by setting individual seller goals based on your group’s needs.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p>
<p>Be sure to <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""/tracking-school-fundraisers"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraiser progress</a> and remind participants to invite people to your store. When your participants reach their individual goals, your group succeeds.</p>
<p>We encourage groups to supplement their fundraiser with incentives.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>

<li><strong>Group Credit Only:</strong> Or, supporters have the option to click on ‘Shop Now’, then ‘Organization Credit Only’ and enter the organization ID number. Participants would only need to share the online store link and your group’s ID #. No participant registration required.</li>
</ol>


<p>We can also create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels.

<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive its own school ID number. Participants will need it to register and share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Registration:</strong> Or, as an option we will send you a link that you can provide to your participants to forward to their family and friends.

</ol>
<p>By using quick registration, you would only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual seller. Sellers would not receive prize credit for any sales made online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, people can donate in $25 increments. Your group receives 70% profit off all donations.</p>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Crazy Socks</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $10 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $10 = $6,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $6,000 x 40% = <strong>$2,400</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

</p><ul>
<li>The number of participants who have registered</li>
<li>How many unique visitors each participant has had</li>
<li>Individual participant and group sales progress</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in the group’s account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> Once we receive your brochure invoice payment, we’ll send your online sales profit check.</p>
<p><strong>Donations:</strong> Any profits from donations are included with the online sales check.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee but buyers pay a 5% processing fee to have their order shipped to your group.</p>

<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $20 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $20 = $12,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $12,000 x 40% = <strong>$4,800</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<p>A money envelope is attached to the flier for inserting cash or checks.

<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>

<p>Yes. Supporters can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>Cookie Cravings</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>

<p>Yes. Our prize programs are optional but recommended. You can boost sales by incentivizing your participants. It’s important to discuss your incentive plan at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to remind your participants about your prizes throughout your campaign. This will keep them motivated to sell.</p>
<p>If your group has 100 or more participants, a prize flyer is placed in each seller’s packet. For smaller groups, the sponsor receives a PDF with their ‘fundraiser supply kit’ email.</p>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Cookie Cravings</i> fundraiser. Before your sale, you’ll receive registration instructions to pass onto your participants. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure. You will need to let us know if you only want to display your specific brochure items.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to sell our products online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once at the store, buyers will see a personalized message from the participant they’re supporting. For example, “Purchases from this site support John Doe at ABC Band”.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, you will be provided a link to forward to your participants. Once they click on it and register, they will receive their own unique online store link via email. They can then share their link with others using social media, text, and/ or email</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. Your group would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p><i>Cookie Cravings</i> does not offer a donation option.</p></div>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />
</p><table border=""0"">

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee but buyers pay a 5% processing fee to have their order shipped to your group.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>

<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Celebrate Spring</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>

<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to promote your sale online. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll gain access to powerful online sales tools that make sharing your fundraiser with their friends and family easy.</p>
<p>We’ll provide you with instructions to pass onto your group so they can register. Once registered participants will be able to share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email. Registered sellers will also be able to track their own online orders.</p>
<p>Clicking on the link takes people to your store. At the top, they'll see a ‘Reason to Support’ button appears above the name of your group. Your purpose is displayed once the supporter clicks the button. This way, they can see the reason for your fundraiser. This helps personalize your cause. For example, “With your help, we'll reach our $2,000 goal for new band equipment.”</p>
<p>If using one of our prize plans to encourage more sales, we recommend supplementing it with their own rewards. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Students don’t have to be registered to earn prize credit. Non-registered students just won’t have access to the online sales tools.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with non-registered sellers is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>You will not receive a unique link for your group. Rather, once participants register, they’ll receive their own shopping link. They’ll be able to email, or text their link direct from their dashboard, and share on social media.</p>
<p>If you don’t want your sellers to register, you can always register yourself first and then ask your group to promote your link.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, people can donate in $20 increments. Your group receives 70% profit off all donations.</p>
<p>Or if you don't want a donation option on your store you can have this feature turned off. Simply let us know before your fundraiser start date.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Multiple participants can be added under the same account when registering. So when they make a purchase, the prize credit is automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who click on a link that was shared with them through text, email or social media and the sellers are all registered under the same dashboard, the prize credit is also automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who go directly to the store, select shop now, and manually enter the information will need to click on the “+” symbol to add multiple participants prior to entering the online store.</p>
<p>Donations count as 1 prize credit for each $20 donation.</p></div>

<p>Before entering the store, supporters will see a personalized group confirmation popup. For example, “Every purchase supports ABC High School Band"". The participant's name and picture (optional) they're supporting also appears. They can start shopping once they click on the ‘shop’ button.</p>

<p>We can also create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels.

If you want this option simply let us know in the comments section when submitting your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</p>

<h3>How soon do we receive our order?</h3>
<div>
<p>We deliver brochure orders to your group 3-4 weeks after receiving your order forms. Online orders generally ship to customers within 2 business days after purchase.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where do orders ship to?</h3>
<div>
<p>Product ships out of our Texas warehouse to all lower 48 states.</p>
</div>
<h3>How is our order packed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Orders arrive prepacked by seller.</p>

<h5>Brochure Sales:</h5>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes this is an option. Instead of shipping <i>Happy Holly Days</i> brochure orders to your group, we’ll ship them to each participants. Sellers would then need to distribute items to their customers.</p>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your group raises money when your participants take brochure orders.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Every participant receives a catalog, order taker, and money collection envelope.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p>
<p>Or, people can pay using their phone if you choose our ‘ship to buyer’ option.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>'Tis the Season</i> brochure sale.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Our incentive programs are optional but encouraged. Motivating your sellers with prizes can increase sales. It’s important to discuss your prize plan at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to promote your prizes throughout your sale. This will keep your group inspired.</p>
<p>There is no cost to the group for our incentives.</p>

</div>",
2983,1,1643480950,"<h3>Online Store</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>'Tis the Season</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to promote your sale online. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll gain access to powerful online sales tools that make sharing your fundraiser with their friends and family easy.</p>
<p>We’ll provide you with instructions to pass onto your group so they can register. Once registered participants will be able to share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email. Registered sellers will also be able to track their own online orders.</p>
<p>Clicking on the link takes people to your store. At the top, they'll see a ‘Reason to Support’ button appears above the name of your group. Your purpose is displayed once the supporter clicks the button. This way, they can see the reason for your fundraiser. This helps personalize your cause. For example, “With your help, we'll reach our $2,000 goal for new band equipment.”</p>
<p>If using one of our prize plans to encourage more sales, we recommend supplementing it with their own rewards. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Students don’t have to be registered to earn prize credit. Non-registered students just won’t have access to the online sales tools.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with non-registered sellers is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>You will not receive a unique link for your group. Rather, once participants register, they’ll receive their own shopping link. They’ll be able to email, or text their link direct from their dashboard, and share on social media.</p>
<p>If you don’t want your sellers to register, you can always register yourself first and then ask your group to promote your link.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, people can donate in $20 increments. Your group receives 70% profit off all donations.</p>
<p>Or if you don't want a donation option on your store you can have this feature turned off. Simply let us know before your fundraiser start date.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Multiple participants can be added under the same account when registering. So when they make a purchase, the prize credit is automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who click on a link that was shared with them through text, email or social media and the sellers are all registered under the same dashboard, the prize credit is also automatically split up.</p>
<p>Buyers who go directly to the store, select shop now, and manually enter the information will need to click on the “+” symbol to add multiple participants prior to entering the online store.</p>
<p>Donations count as 1 prize credit for each $20 donation.</p></div>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>'Tis the Season</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participants = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $18 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $18 = $10,800.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $10,800 x 40% = <strong>$4,320</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>

<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in the group’s account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>

<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>

<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>

<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>

<h5>Brochure Sales:</h5>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />
</p><table border=""0"">

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee but buyers pay a 5% processing fee to have their order shipped to your group.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes this is an option. Instead of shipping <i>Heartland Goodies & Gifts</i> brochure orders to your group, we’ll ship them to each participant. Sellers would then need to distribute items to their customers.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in your account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once the order has been processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> Once your brochure invoice has been paid in full, a check for any online sales is sent to your group.</p>
<p><strong>Donations:</strong> Any profits from donations are included with the online sales check.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups make 40% off all <i>Snow Much Fun</i> brochure and online sales.</p>
<p>You receive 70% of online donations.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p></div>
<h3>What about sales tax?</h3>
<div>
<p>Certain states require that we collect and remit sales tax on your behalf to your state’s department of revenue. We will need to charge sales tax if your state has determined that we have established <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/nexus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nexus</a> and you are not tax exempt.

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How soon do we receive our order?</h3>
<div>
<p>We deliver brochure orders to your group 3-4 weeks after receiving your order forms. Online orders generally ship to customers within 2 business days after purchase.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where do orders ship to?</h3>
<div>
<p>Product ships out of our Texas warehouse to all lower 48 states.</p>
</div>
<h3>How is our order packed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Orders arrive prepacked by seller.</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a shipping fee?</h3>
<div>
<h5>Brochure Sales:</h5>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes this is an option. Instead of shipping <i>Snow Much Fun</i> brochure orders to your group, we’ll ship them to each participant. Sellers would then need to distribute items to their customers.</p>
<p>Home delivery fundraisers go by the following profit margins:</p>

2913,1,1642276451,"<h2>Questions about A Season of Joy?</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your group raises money when your participants take orders from the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each participant receives a brochure, order form, and zip-lock bag for money collection.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>A Season of Joy</i> brochure fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Prize programs are optional but recommended. Incentivizing your participants can improve sales. It’s important to discuss your prize program at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to promote your incentives throughout your sale. This will keep your group motivated.</p>
<p>If your group has 100 or more participants, a prize flyer is placed in each seller’s packet. For smaller groups, the sponsor receives a PDF with their ‘fundraiser supply kit’ email.</p>
<p>There is no cost to the group for our incentive plans.</p>
<p><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/fundraiser-prize-programs"" target=""_blank"">Learn about our prize programs</a></p></div>
<h3>How soon can we start?</h3>
<div>
<p>After you submit our <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form you’ll receive an agreement to sign. It will then take at least 7-10 business days to process your order and pack and ship out your supplies.</p>
<p><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/school-fundraising-supply-timeline"" target=""_blank"">Learn about our timeline</a></p></div>
<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>
<div>
<p>By default, we’ll set your end date 2 weeks after your start date. You can always change your end date. Simply let us know before your sale ends.</p></div>
</div>",
2913,1,1642276451,"<h3>Online Store</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, an online store is automatically included. Prior to your <i>A Season of Joy</i> kickoff you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> revenue source to your fundraiser.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to raise money online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>The link takes people to your store where the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it identifiable to friends and family. For example, “Purchases from this page will be credited to John Doe in support of ABC High School Band.”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">additional incentives</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive a unique program ID number. Participants will need it to register and share their store link with others using social media, text, and email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can register and obtain your unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold or prize credit.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. Participants need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>
</div>",

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>A Season of Joy</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $15 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $15 = $9,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $9,000 x 40% = <strong>$3,600</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Cheesecake Factory & More</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to track their online sales.</p>
<p>Sellers can share your online store link using text, social media, and/ or email. If participants have registered, once supporters click on the link and arrive at your store, they will see a personalized message. For example, “You're shopping for John Doe” (name of participant). Sellers also have the option to upload their photo.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Participants will need your group link to register. This way they can login and track their sales progress. When they share the link with friends and family using social media, text, and/ or email, visitors will see the participant’s name when they arrive at the store.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> If you don’t want your group members to register they can simply send out your group link.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. Supporters can choose to donate either $50 or $75. You make 70% off each donation.</p></div>
</div>",
2893,1,1644360745,"<h3>Making Sales</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. You must order at least 25 cases. Cheesecakes and snack items contain 6 units per case, cookie dough and pumpkin roll cases have 8 units, and each cinnamon roll case consists of 10 units. Full case orders only. No combining flavors to fill cases.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit <i>(based on cheesecakes only)</i>:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold ÷ 6 items / Case = Cases Ordered</li>
<li>Cases Ordered x Profit / Case = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant goal at 10 items. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Since there are 6 items in each case, the total cases sold would be 600 items ÷ 6 items / 1 case = 100 cases. (Round up to next whole number if needed)</li>
<li>100 cases x $48.00 profit / case = <strong>$4,800</strong>. <i>(See chart below)</i></li>

<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Edible Cookie Dough</i> fundraiser. Before your sale, you’ll receive registration instructions to pass onto your participants. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure. You will need to let us know if you only want to display your specific brochure items.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to sell our products online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once at the store, buyers will see a personalized message from the participant they’re supporting. For example, “Purchases from this site support John Doe at ABC Band”.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, you will be provided a link to forward to your participants. Once they click on it and register, they will receive their own unique online store link via email. They can then share their link with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. Your group would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p><i>Edible Cookie Dough</i> does not offer a donation option.</p></div>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, online selling is an important part of your <i>Simply Delicious</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to generate <i>Simply Delicious</i> sales online. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once potential buyers are at the store, the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it recognizable to friends and family. For example, “Thank you for supporting John Doe with ABC High School Band!”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive its own group ID number. Participants will need it to register and share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels. Your group would also be able to share your link with their friends and family. If you want this option simply let us know in the comments section when submitting your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, <i>Simply Delicious</i> can be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount. You have the option to turn this feature off when logged into your portal.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can choose to support more than 1 participant. Before continuing to the store, supporters would need to select a participant. Then choose the ‘Support another seller’ link to add another participant.</p>
<p>However, participants themselves need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Simply Delicious</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $18 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $18 = $10,800.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $10,800 x 40% = <strong>$4,320</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:

<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>

<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them.</p>

<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, online selling is an important part of your <i>One Price Otis Spunkmeyer</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to generate <i>One Price Otis Spunkmeyer</i> sales online. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once potential buyers are at the store, the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it recognizable to friends and family. For example, “Thank you for supporting John Doe with ABC High School Band!”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive its own group ID number. Participants will need it to register and share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels. Your group would also be able to share your link with their friends and family. If you want this option simply let us know in the comments section when submitting your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, <i>One Price Otis Spunkmeyer</i> can be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount. You have the option to turn this feature off when logged into your portal.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can choose to support more than 1 participant. Before continuing to the store, supporters would need to select a participant. Then choose the ‘Support another seller’ link to add another participant.</p>
<p>However, participants themselves need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>One Price Otis Spunkmeyer</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $20 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $20 = $12,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $12,000 x 40% = <strong>$4,800</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Perfectly Preportioned</i> cookie dough fundraiser. Before your sale, you’ll receive registration instructions to pass onto your participants. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>

<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to sell our products online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once at the store, buyers will see a personalized message from the participant they’re supporting. For example, “Purchases from this site support John Doe at ABC Band”.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, you will be provided a link to forward to your participants. Once they click on it and register, they will receive their own unique online store link via email. They can then share their link with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. Your group would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Perfectly Preportioned</i> cookie dough fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $19 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $19 = $11,400.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $11,400 x 40% = <strong>$4,560</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $14 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $14 = $8,400.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $8,400 x 40% = <strong>$3,360</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee but buyers pay a 5% processing fee to have their order shipped to your group.</p>

<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Drinkware Done Differently</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to track their online sales.</p>
<p>Sellers can share your online store link using text, social media, and/ or email. If participants have registered, once supporters click on the link and arrive at your store, they will see a personalized message. For example, “You're shopping for John Doe” (name of participant). Sellers also have the option to upload their photo.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales.

<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Participants will need your group link to register. This way they can login and track their sales progress. When they share the link with friends and family using social media, text, and/ or email, visitors will see the participant’s name when they arrive at the store.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> If you don’t want your group members to register they can simply send out your group link.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation to sellers not registering is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Candle Cottage</i> fundraiser. Before your sale, you’ll receive instructions to pass onto your participants. They’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>

2693,1,1642276831,"<h3>Making Sales</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Candle Cottage</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $25 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $25 = $15,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $15,000 x 40% = <strong>$6,000</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>
<h3>Can we track our sales?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure:</strong> You probably won’t know how many orders you get until you collect your order forms. But there are strategies that can give you a ballpark idea. Learn how to <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/how-track-your-fundraising-progress"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraising progress</a></p>
<p><strong>Online:</strong> You'll receive daily sales updates whenever you click on the link that we’ll provide to you. You’ll see how many sales you make each day as well as your total sales amount.</p></div>
<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in your group account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> Once we receive your brochure invoice payment, we’ll send your online sales profit check.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups make 40% off all <i>Candle Cottage</i> items.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p></div>
<h3>What about sales tax?</h3>
<div>
<p>Certain states require that we collect and remit sales tax on your behalf to your state’s department of revenue. We will need to charge sales tax if your state has determined that we have established <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/nexus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nexus</a> and you are not tax exempt.

<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> revenue source to your fundraiser.</p>

<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to raise money online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>The link takes people to your store where the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it identifiable to friends and family. For example, “Purchases from this page will be credited to John Doe in support of ABC High School Band.”</p>

<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive a unique program ID number. Participants will need it to register and share their store link with others using social media, text, and email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can register and obtain your unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>

<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, we can create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels. Your group would also be able to share your link with their friends and family. If you want this option simply let us know in the comments section when submitting your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>Amazing Dough</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $19 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $19 = $11,400.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $11,400 x 40% = <strong>$4,560</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>

<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> We deduct your online sales profit from your invoice. If you raise more money online, we’ll send you a check for the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Donations:</strong> Any profits from donations are deducted from your brochure invoice.</p></div>

<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Participants will need your group link to register. This way they can login and track their sales progress. When they share the link with friends and family using social media, text, and/ or email, visitors will see the participant’s name when they arrive at the store.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> If you don’t want your group members to register they can simply send out your group link.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. Supporters can choose to donate either $50 or $75. You make 70% off each donation.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. You must order at least 25 cases. All flavors come in cases of 6. Full case orders only. No combining flavors to fill cases.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold ÷ 6 items / Case = Cases Ordered</li>
<li>Cases Ordered x Profit / Case = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant goal at 10 items. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Since there are 6 items in each case, the total cases sold would be 600 items ÷ 6 items / 1 case = 100 cases. (Round up to next whole number if needed)</li>
<li>100 cases x $48.00 profit / case = <strong>$4,800</strong>. <i>(See chart below)</i></li>

<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Our prize programs are optional but recommended. You can boost sales by incentivizing your participants. It’s important to discuss your incentive plan at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to remind your participants about your prizes throughout your campaign. This will keep them motivated to sell.</p>

<p>Yes, online selling is an important part of your <i>Cinnabon & Pretzel</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to generate <i>Cinnabon & Pretzel</i> sales online. It's also a very effective way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Once registered, participants invite people to your store by sharing their unique link. They can do this using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>Once potential buyers are at the store, the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it recognizable to friends and family. For example, “Thank you for supporting John Doe with ABC High School Band!”</p>

Your group would also be able to share your link with their friends and family.

<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, <i>Cinnabon & Pretzel</i> can be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount. You have the option to turn this feature off when logged into your portal.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold and are not available if using a prize program.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can choose to support more than 1 participant. Before continuing to the store, supporters would need to select a participant. Then choose the ‘Support another seller’ link to add another participant.</p>

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee but buyers pay a 5% processing fee to have their order shipped to your group.</p>

<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>

</div>",
1475,1,1642277435,"<h3>Online Store</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, selling online is an important part of your <i>Perfect Pies</i> fundraiser. Prior to your start date you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the best way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to track their online sales.</p>
<p>Sellers can share your online store link using text, social media, and/ or email. If participants have registered, once supporters click on the link and arrive at your store, they will see a personalized message. For example, “You're shopping for John Doe” (name of participant). Sellers also have the option to upload their photo.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. This can bring in even more sales. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Participants will need your group link to register. This way they can login and track their sales progress. When they share the link with friends and family using social media, text, and/ or email, visitors will see the participant’s name when they arrive at the store.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> If you don’t want your group members to register they can simply send out your group link.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. Supporters can choose to donate either $50 or $75. You make 70% off each donation.</div>
</div>",
1475,1,1642277435,"<h3>Making Sales</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. You must order at least 25 cases. All flavors come in cases of 6. Full case orders only. No combining flavors to fill cases.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold ÷ 8 items / Case = Cases Ordered</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant goal at 10 items. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Since there are 6 items in each case, the total cases sold would be 600 items ÷ 6 items / 1 case  = 100 cases. (Round up to next whole number if needed)</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is $20 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $20 = $12,000.</li>
<li>Based on selling 100 cases your profit would be 40% <i>(See chart below)</i>. So your group profit would be $12,000 x 40% = <strong>$4,800</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participants goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participant = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $10 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $10 = $6,000.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $6,000 x 40% = <strong>$2,400</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>
<h3>Can we track our sales?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure:</strong> You probably won’t know how many orders you get until you collect your order forms. Yet there are strategies that can give you a ballpark idea. Learn how to <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/how-track-your-fundraising-progress"" target=""_blank"">track your fundraising progress</a></p>
<p><strong>Online:</strong> You'll receive up-to-date sales information whenever you log into your dashboard. You'll see participants who’ve sent emails to friends and family as well as the latest sales activity.</p></div>
<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in your group account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> Once we receive your brochure invoice payment, we’ll send your online sales profit check.</p>
<p><strong>Donations:</strong> Any profits from donations are included with the online sales check.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups make 40% off all <i>Chocolate Indulgence</i> items.</p>
<p>You receive 70% of online donations.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p></div>
<h3>What about sales tax?</h3>
<div>
<p>Certain states require that we collect and remit sales tax on your behalf to your state’s department of revenue. We will need to charge sales tax if your state has determined that we have established <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/nexus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nexus</a> and you are not tax exempt.

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How soon do we receive our order?</h3>
<div>
<p>We deliver brochure orders to your group 3-4 weeks after receiving your order forms. Online orders generally ship to customers within 2 business days after purchase.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where do orders ship to?</h3>
<div>
<p>Product ships out of our Texas warehouse to all lower 48 states.</p>
</div>
<h3>How is our order packed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Orders deliver prepacked by seller.</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a shipping fee?</h3>
<div>
<h5>Brochure Sales:</h5>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />
</p><table border=""0"">

</tbody>
</table>

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
<p>Buyers also have the option to ship their order to the group. In this case there is no shipping fee.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you ship orders to sellers?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes this is an option. Instead of shipping <i>Chocolate Indulgence</i> brochure orders to your group, we’ll ship them to each participant. Sellers would then need to distribute items to their customers.</p>
<p>Home delivery fundraisers go by the following profit margins:</p>

<p> Orders under $1,000 in gross sales will be shipped to the group.</p></div>
<h3>How are product issued handled?</h3>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your group raises money when participants take orders from their brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Every participant receives a snack food brochure, order form, and money envelope.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Supporters can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>Virginia Diner</i> snack food fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Our prize programs are optional but encouraged. You can improve sales by offering prizes to your participants. It’s important to discuss our incentives at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to remind your participants about them throughout your sale. This will keep them motivated.</p>
<p>If your group has 100 or more participants, a prize flyer is placed in each seller’s packet. For smaller groups, the sponsor receives a PDF with their ‘fundraiser supply kit’ email.</p>
<p>There is no cost for our incentives.</p>

<h3>How soon can we start?</h3>
<div>

<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your sale lasts for 2 weeks. You can always change your end date. Simply let us know before your sale is over.</p></div>
</div>",
1188,1,1642276943,"<h3>Online Store</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, an online store is automatically included. Prior to your <i>Virginia Diner</i> kickoff you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> revenue source to your fundraiser.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to raise money online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>The link takes people to your store where the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it identifiable to friends and family. For example, “Purchases from this page will be credited to John Doe in support of ABC High School Band.”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">additional incentives</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive a unique program ID number. Participants will need it to register and share their store link with others using social media, text, and email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can register and obtain your unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold or prize credit.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. Participants need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>

<p>Selling online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> way for your group to raise money.</p>
<p>Your online store will include additional items not found in the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to promote your <i>CW Home</i> fundraiser online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. Participants can share the store link and their participant code # once they register.</p>
<p>Before entering the store, supporters will see a personalized group confirmation popup. For example, “Every purchase supports ABC High School Band"". The participant's name and picture (optional) they're supporting also appears. They can start shopping once they click on the ‘shop’ button.</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own rewards. Here are some <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">incentive ideas</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> Your group will receive its own organization ID number. Participants will need it to register and share your store with others using social media, text, and/ or email.</li>
<li><strong>Group Credit Only:</strong> Or, supporters can select ‘Shop Now’, then ‘Organization Credit Only’ and enter your ID number. Your participants would only need to share the online store link and your organization’s ID #. No participant registration required.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can also create a unique link that would bypass the registration process. You can then post the link on your website as well as on various social media channels. Your group would be able to share your link with their friends and family. If you want this option simply let us know in the comments section when submitting your <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form.</p>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p><i>CW Home</i> does not offer a donation option.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once at the store, supporters can click on the 'Shop Now' button, then 'Participants'. To the right of the highlighted text that says 'Supporting more than 1 participant? (Optional)', select 'Click Here'. Sales credit can be given to up to 3 participants.</p></div>

<h3>Is there a minimum order?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no order requirements for a <i>CW Home</i> fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>How much money can we make?</h3>
<div>
<p>You’ll need to know your group size as well your participant goal. Here’s how you can estimate your profit:</p>
<h2>Calculation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Participant Count x Participant Item Goal = Items Sold</li>
<li>Items Sold x Average Retail Price = Gross Sales</li>
<li>Gross Sales x Profit % = Group Profit</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Let’s say you have 60 participants and you set your participant item goal at 10. The items sold would be 60 participants x 10 Items / participants = 600.</li>
<li>Next, determine your gross sales. The average retail price is about $17 so your gross sales would be 600 Items x $17 = $10,200.</li>
<li>Since your profit is 40%, your group profit would be $10,200 x 40% = <strong>$4,080</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, our example is only an estimated profit. In reality, participants probably won’t sell the same number of items. In addition, the average retail dollars sold per seller will vary.</p></div>
<h3>Can we track our sales?</h3>
<div>

</p><ul>
<li>The number of participants who've registered</li>
<li>How many have sent out invite emails</li>
<li>Sales progress</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>How do we receive our money?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Brochure Sales:</strong> Money and order forms are turned in at the end of the sale. The money gets deposited in the group’s account and the order forms are sent in for processing.</p>
<p>Once orders are processed, the group receives their sales reports and invoice. The group sends a check for the invoice amount and keeps the rest as profit.</p>
<p><strong>Online Sales:</strong> A credit will appear on your brochure invoice for your online sales profit.</p></div>
<h3>What is our profit?</h3>
<div>
<p>Groups make 40% off all regular and 30% off any customizable <i>CW Home</i> items.</p>
<p><i>(Use the ‘Calculate Your Profit’ calculator at the top of the page to determine your profit)</i></p></div>
<h3>What about sales tax?</h3>
<div>
<p>Certain states require that we collect and remit sales tax on your behalf to your state’s department of revenue. We will need to charge sales tax if your state has determined that we have established <a title=""opens in new window"" href=""https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/nexus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nexus</a> and you are not tax exempt.

677,1,1642276492,"<h2>Questions about Spring is in the Air?</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>How do we raise money?</h3>
<div>
<p>Your group raises money when your participants take orders from the brochure.</p></div>
<h3>Do participants get a brochure to show?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each participant receives a brochure, order form, and zip-lock bag for money collection.</p></div>
<h3>Is money collected up front?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Buyers can pay by check, cash, money order, or cashier’s check.</p></div>
<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are no setup fees or supply costs to start a <i>Spring is in the Air</i> brochure fundraiser.</p></div>
<h3>Can participants earn prizes?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes. Prize programs are optional but recommended. Incentivizing your participants can improve sales. It’s important to discuss your prize program at your kickoff meeting. Then, continue to promote your incentives throughout your sale. This will keep your group motivated.</p>
<p>If your group has 100 or more participants, a prize flyer is placed in each seller’s packet. For smaller groups, the sponsor receives a PDF with their ‘fundraiser supply kit’ email.</p>
<p>There is no cost to the group for our incentive plans.</p>
<p><a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/fundraiser-prize-programs"" target=""_blank"">Learn about our prize programs</a></p></div>
<h3>How soon can we start?</h3>
<div>
<p>After you submit our <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/contact/start-fundraiser"" target=""_blank"">start a fundraiser</a> form you’ll receive an agreement to sign. It will then take at least 7-10 business days to process your order and pack and ship out your supplies.</p>

<h3>How long is the fundraiser?</h3>
<div>
<p>By default, we’ll set your end date 2 weeks after your start date. You can always change your end date. Simply let us know before your sale ends.</p></div>

<div class=""accordion1"">
<h3>Can we also raise money online?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, an online store is automatically included. Prior to your <i>Spring is in the Air</i> kickoff you’ll receive instructions so your participants can register. Once registered they’ll be able to invite friends and family to shop at your store.</p>
<p>Raising money online adds a 2<sup>nd</sup> revenue source to your fundraiser.</p>

<h3>Do participants need to register?</h3>
<div>
<p>Registration is the most effective way to raise money online. It's also a great way to get your participants engaged in your cause. As participants register, they’ll be able to share their unique link using text, social media, and/ or email.</p>
<p>The link takes people to your store where the participant’s name appears at the top of the page. This helps make it identifiable to friends and family. For example, “Purchases from this page will be credited to John Doe in support of ABC High School Band.”</p>
<p>Registered sellers will also be eligible to earn credit towards prizes. We encourage groups to supplement our prize program with their own <a title=""Opens in new window"" href=""/resources/additional-fundraising-incentive-ideas"" target=""_blank"">additional incentives</a>.</p></div>
<h3>Do we get our own link?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are 2 ways to promote your store:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> By default, your group will receive a unique program ID number. Participants will need it to register and share their store link with others using social media, text, and email.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Link:</strong> Or, you as the sponsor can register and obtain your unique link first. Then share that link with your entire group. Participants would be able to share your link with their friends and family.</li>
</ol>
<p>By promoting a direct link, you will only be able to track online sales as a group, not by individual sellers. As a result, participants would not receive prize credit for selling online.</p>
<p><strong>Online Ship to Group Orders</strong></p>
<p>Another limitation with a single store link is getting items to online customers who choose the ‘ship to group’ option. Normally when participants register and send out their own unique links and customers make a purchase, orders are automatically tied to a particular seller.</p>
<p>Any items then ship to the group already packed inside the seller’s box with their other brochure items. Participants then deliver these items to their customers.</p>
<p>But with the single link option, you will need to let any ‘ship to group’ buyers know to pick up their order because it won’t be associated with any seller.</p></div>
<h3>Can we accept donations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, your store will be set up to accept donations. You make 70% of the donated amount.</p>
<p>Donations do not count towards items sold or prize credit.</p></div>
<h3>Can buyers credit more than 1 participant?</h3>
<div>
<p>No. Participants need to register individually. Each participant has their own login and sharing options.</p></div>

<p>Shipping is free if certain order minimums are met:
</p><p><strong>Groups up to 100 participants</strong></p>
<p>If you sell 150 or more items there is no shipping charge. A $100 shipping and handling fee will be charged for orders with fewer than 150 items sold.</p>
<p><strong>Groups with over 100 participants</strong>
</p><p>Shipping is free as long as your group averages $20 or more in retail sales per member. (Since the average price of an item listed in a typical brochure is about $14, that is less than 2 items sold per seller)<br />

<p>A quick way to determine your average retail sales per enrolled is to divide your total sales by your group enrollment. Consider the following 2 examples.</p>
<p>If your group raises:
</p><ol>
<li>$2,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $16.67. In this case you would be charged 50¢ x 150 = $75 (See chart above).</li>
<li>$3,500 with 150 members, your average retail sales per enrolled would be $23.33. In this case you would not be charged a shipping fee because you reached $20 per enrolled group member.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Both brochure and online sales count towards the free shipping minimum requirement</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h5>Online Sales:</h5>

<p>Customers pay a shipping fee at checkout to have their order shipped direct to them. Shipping is free on orders over $75.</p>
